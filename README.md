This is a simple text summarization app that will work with any web link or YouTube video that you paste in. 
There is also a tweet generation feature that will generate a SCO friendly tweet based on the text provided.
You need to have a Ollama installed and running for this to work as well as llama3 8b installed.

If you want to turn this into a actual app on mac download pyinstaller. 

pip install pyinstaller

You can rebuild the executable using the .spec file in terminal.

pyinstaller --Instasumup.spec
